Squircle (beginner)
--------------
Easily add a Squircle in your app.

1) Copy "Squircle" folder in your "src" folder

2) Add this to your qml file header where you want to add a Squircle:
```sh
#include "Squircle" // Import all qml files from Squircle folder
```

3) Now you only have to add the Squircle custom component
```sh
        Squircle {
            isDarkTheme: true
        }
```
